# Gatekeeper 

A simple tool for monitoring vehicles entering/exiting a property.


## Security

While Gatekeeper is designed to be secure and reliable, it is not recommended that you expose it to the internet. Gatekeeper is designed to run on a local area network, and should only receive information from local Predator Fabric instances.


## Description

Gatekeeper is a web utility that interfaces with one or more [Predator Fabric](https://v0lttech.com/predatorfabric.php) instances on the local network to monitor when vehicles enter/exit a property. The intended use case for Gatekeeper is for home owners who want to receive detailed notifications when someone enters their property, as well as the ability to quickly identify them. However, it is worth clarify that Gatekeeper is not intended to be a security tool, and you should not rely on it for safety critical notifications.


## Features

### Lightweight

Gatekeeper is lightweight, and can run on an inexpensive single-board computer.

### Customizable

Gatekeeper is designed with tinkering in mind. All source code is well documented, and easy to modify.
